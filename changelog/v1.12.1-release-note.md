# v1.12.1 Release Note

## Summary
v1.12.1 is the first maintenance release after the latest release v1.12.0. It
comes with several important improvements and fixes for the API functionality.
It also contains an enhanced configuration of the transaction pool, which would
double the pool's capacity, allow it to buffer more pending transactions and
increase the IoTeX blockchain's resilience against large traffic volume.

## Major Improvements
1. Correct signature's V value in returned web3 transaction, to fix the transaction
hash calculation
2. Support "input" field in web3 request params to increase the compatibility with
latest web3js standard
3. Set gRPC MaxConnectionIdle time to 5 minutes to improve the API server performance
and responsiveness

## Upgrade Priority
v1.12.1 does not have a hardfork, and contains API service improvements. Only API
nodes should upgrade in order to provide the best up-to-date service

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Not required |
| Fullnode   | Not required |
| API node   | Recommended  |
