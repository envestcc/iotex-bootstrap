# v1.14.0 Release Note

## Summary
**v1.14.0 has a hardfork, which will be activated at block height 29,378,521
(ETA is around 04/08/2024 23:52pm UTC) on IoTeX mainnet.**

All nodes **must** upgrade to this release, otherwise the node runs the risk of
not being able to sync with the IoTeX blockchain after other nodes have upgraded.

**Note:**
There's no change to the mainnet config.yaml and genesis.yaml. You only need to
restart your node with the new v1.14.0 image.

Version 1.14.0 has enabled two significant new features: IIP-24 Raise Block Gas
Limit to 50M and IIP-25 delegate endorsement.

With IIP-24, the block gas limit has now been raised to 50M, greatly enhancing
the processing capabilities of the IoTeX blockchain while ensuring its stability.
This enhancement allows the blockchain to achieve a maximum of 1000 TPS
(transactions per second), significantly speeding up transaction processing on
the blockchain, especially during times of network congestion.

The activation of IIP-25 introduces a novel governance model: it allows big
stakeholder to create a bucket for endorsing delegate. This would make delegate
management more flexible and encourage more enthusiastic projects to become IoTeX
delegates and actively participate in the IoTeX network operation, thereby
fostering the inclusivity of the IoTeX network and enhancing the diversity of the
ecosystem.

## Other Improvements
v1.14.0 release also comes with a couple of improvements:
1. Improved performance for DB snapshot operation
2. Enabled web3js format for CandidateActivate and CandidateEndorsement
3. Make action pick order deterministic
4. Added more unit tests and end-to-end tests

## Upgrade Priority
v1.14.0 comes with a hardfork, so all nodes **must** upgrade in order to keep
syncing with the IoTeX blockchain

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Must upgrade |
| Fullnode   | Must upgrade |
