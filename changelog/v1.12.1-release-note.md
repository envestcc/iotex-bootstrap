# v1.12.1 Release Note

## Summary
v1.12.1 is the first maintenance release after the latest release v1.12.0. It
comes with several important improvements and fixes for the API functionality.
This release introduces a significant enhancement to the transaction pool
functionality. First, pending transactions that can soon be included in upcoming
blocks will no longer be expired. Secondly, a mechanism has been implemented to
replace less favorable pending transactions with more promising ones when the
transaction pool approaches its capacity limit. This helps to ensure a higher
likelihood of executing more successful transactions on the blockchain. With these
improvement, we anticipate a relatively more stable block size, and legitimate
transactions with higher gas prices stand a better chance of being swiftly processed
on the blockchain, thereby enhancing the end user's experience.

## Major Improvements
1. Correct signature's V value in returned web3 transaction, to fix the transaction
hash calculation
2. Support "input" field in web3 request params to increase the compatibility with
latest web3js standard
3. Set gRPC MaxConnectionIdle time to 5 minutes to improve the API server performance
and responsiveness

## Upgrade Priority
v1.12.1 does not have a hardfork, but contains important feature improvements to boost
the transaction pool functionality. All delegate nodes and API nodes are strongly
recommended to upgrade to v1.12.1 in order to provide the best up-to-date service

| Node type  | Action       |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Delegate   | Recommended  |
| Fullnode   | Not required |
| API node   | Recommended  |
